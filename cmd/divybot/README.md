# divybot — the new orchid (single Go file)

A GitHub-issue → PR swarm coordinator over a **herdr fabric**. One file
(`main.go`, stdlib only). Replaces the old multi-file orchid: **no** SSH+tmux
shim, **no** capture-pane scrape, **no** paste-buffer pokes, **no** dashboard,
**no** clawpatrol.

## How it works

```
poll GitHub issues → governor-admit → push creds → herdr spawn (BARE claude/codex)
   → inject goal → supervise via herdr agent_status → poll PRs, relay reviews/CI/
   conflicts via herdr send → teardown
```

- **Transport** is native herdr over plain SSH (`ssh <host> herdr <cmd>`, JSON
  out). herdr is the per-host runtime + perception layer; the coordinator is a
  thin client. No tmux, no shim.
- **Perception** is herdr's native `agent_status` (`idle|working|blocked|done|
  unknown`), one structured call per host per tick — not a 5Hz pane scrape.
  `blocked` → escalate (ntfy); `idle/done` with no PR → re-inject the goal
  (fixes the gcp strandings); a `Invalid bearer`/`not trusted` read → resync
  creds + respawn.
- **Auth is central.** The coordinator owns the canonical `claude` oauth +
  `codex` auth + gh token and pushes them to every host on spawn and every
  20 min (before the oauth access token expires). This kills the entire
  per-host stale-credential 401/JWT class that bit vultr-claude and vultr-codex.
- **Governor kept.** Curls Anthropic's API with the synced oauth token, reads
  the unified rate-limit headers (5h/weekly used%), and caps concurrent agents
  so the swarm never blows the Max weekly quota. Slim threshold control
  (pause above ceiling, throttle within slack, else MaxActive); fail-open.
- **PR review/CI/conflict polling is unchanged** from orchid in spirit (`diff()`
  forwards only NEW reviews/comments/CI-failures/conflicts) — only the delivery
  channel changed (herdr `agent send`, not paste-buffer).

## Run

```sh
go build -o divybot ./cmd/divybot
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) ./divybot -config divybot.json
./divybot -config divybot.json -once   # single tick, for testing
```

## Prerequisites (cutover)

1. **Each host's herdr server runs as the agent user**, and the coordinator
   ssh-targets that user: `orchid@…` on the VMs, `divy@…` on the mac. (On vultr
   that means herdr-as-orchid + `ssh orchid@localhost`, not root.) Bare claude
   refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as root, so the agent user must be
   unprivileged.
2. **The coordinator host holds the canonical creds**: `~/.claude/.credentials.json`,
   `~/.codex/auth.json`, and a gh token (`GH_TOKEN` or `gh auth token`). These
   are the single source of truth pushed to every host. Keep them logged-in.
3. **herdr ≥ 0.7.0** on every host with the claude/codex integrations installed
   (`herdr integration install claude` / `codex`).
4. No tailnet "join" — a host is usable iff it's on the tailnet and its herdr
   answers. Add/remove boxes by editing `hosts` in the config.

## Cutover

```sh
systemctl stop orchid            # stop the old multi-file orchid
# (old workers keep running in their herdr workspaces; divybot adopts live
#  labels by name on its first tick and supervises them)
./divybot -config divybot.json   # or install as a systemd unit
```

## What's gone vs orchid

| orchid (old)                               | divybot (new) |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------|
| SSH ControlMaster + tmux-shim + capture-pane + paste-buffer | native `herdr` over ssh |
| dashboard (`www/`, `http_api.go`, cf relay) | `herdr --remote <host>` is the UI |
| clawpatrol per-workspace                    | bare claude/codex + central auth-sync |
| `join_managed` / `bootstrapVM` / vm-keys gating | tailnet pool, no join |
| ~13k LOC across 25 files                    | ~1.2k LOC, one file |


### Native Codex goals

For new Codex dispatches, divybot reads the official session report again after
prompt delivery and records the authoritative identity in the existing private
binding. It then creates an active native goal using the assignment title and
reference. The authorized `/swarm max-tokens` value is its token budget. Omit the
key for an unknown budget; zero is an explicit numeric budget. Whole-token decimal
values and exact decimal k/m suffixes are accepted; invalid values refuse before
launch.

The execution environment needs the official herdr Codex integration and the
plain `codex app-server` goal contract. Missing identity stays explicitly
unavailable. An existing goal is not overwritten. Completion, cancellation,
deadline and blocked events update only the status of goals this dispatcher has
verified it created. Native budget/usage limitation statuses remain distinct.

See [RFC 0001](../../docs/rfcs/0001-native-dispatch-goals.md) for ownership,
privacy, uncertainty and the live verification gate.
